- 👋 Hi, I’m @rkbraniff
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide variety of things. My current fixations are Coding, Vampire: The Masquerade, Politics, and Global Current Events
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, leadership, and story writing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on story writing in the form of a writer's room. Anyone that may be interested in joining my discord for Vampire the Masquerade need only ask.
- 📫 How to reach me I am mostly contactable through Discord, but email will be better for a professional setting. Also messaging me through Github is a good option, as I leave this tab open nearly constantly. Response times may vary depending on the day, the level of busy I am, and the time of day. I work nights mostly.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, They/Them, sometimes She/Her but not often, and won't be offended if you don't catch it that day
- ⚡ Fun fact: Waterproof paint is a product of the CIA
